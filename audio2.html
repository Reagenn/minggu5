[Verse 1]
In the dark of night
The stars light up the sky
We see them flying free
That's just like you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone is lonely sometimes
But I would walk a thousand miles
To see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family
Hold me, let's escape all this reality

[Chorus]
You are my symphony
By your side, we are Unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are Unity
We are Unity
We are Unity

[Verse 2]
Although the rain might pour
A thunder starts to roar
The lightning wakes the wave
But through it, we are brave

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone is lonely sometimes
But I would walk a thousand miles
To see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family
Hold me, let's escape all this reality

[Chorus]
You are my symphony
By your side, we are Unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are Unity
(We are...) We are Unity
(We are...) We are Unity

(My Unity)
(My Unity)
(My Unity)
(My Unity)
We are Unity

[Chorus]
You are my symphony
By your side, we are Unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are Unity
We are Unity
We are Unity
